# School Management System

## Introduction
This project is a school management system developed using PySide6 for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Qt Designer for designing the UI components. It is designed to facilitate the management of various aspects of a school system, including student records, courses, grades, and more. The program utilizes various data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and custom data structures to efficiently organize and manage school data.

Instead of relying on a traditional database system, this program supports CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files for storing and accessing data. CSV files provide a lightweight solution for data storage and can be easily manipulated using Python's built-in CSV module. This approach simplifies the setup process and eliminates the need for a separate database management system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PySide6
- Qt Designer
